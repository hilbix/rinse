Reporting Bugs
--------------

  I prefer a bug report to the Debian bug tracking system (BTS).
  Use the tool reportbug or read the instructions at

        http://bugs.debian.org


  You may also use the xen-tools mailing list:

        http://xen-tools.org/lists/

  If you're capable of fixing it yourself a patch is appreciated,
 and a test case would be a useful bonus.
