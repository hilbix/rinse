Rinse
-----

  The rinse utility is designed to install an RPM-based distribution
 within a directory.   The purpose and usage are analagous to the
 'debootstrap' utility familiar to users of Debian GNU/Linux.

  So far only i386 is supported, but AMD-64 support is pending.


Rationale
---------

  This tool is being developed primarily for use by my Xen-Tools
 package; such that new Xen guests may be created of RPM-based
 distributions.

  RPMStrap is the common solution to this problem, however it
 is rarely successfull.


Supported Distributions
-----------------------

  So far the following distributions are supported, more
 may be added in the future:

     *  CentOS
        - 4.4 & 5.0

     *  Fedora Core
        - 6
